description: Horse hunter Lin Sloan never wanted anything more than the wild stallion
  he called Wildfire. Lucy Bostil found the horse and the unconscious man who had
  roped him. She saved both their lives and took Sloan's heart in the process. Now
  another man wants Lucy and the horse and will stop at nothing short of killing to
  get them.
